This process is the only one that touches CUDA, NVML, or a llama-server

Streamlit process crashed it with a heap corruption in ntdll (0xc0000374),
because a UI that reruns its whole script on every keystroke has no business
holding a CUDA context.

    GET  /model          status and placement, without loading anything
    POST /model/load     start llama-server (slow, idempotent)
    POST /model/unload   stop it and free the VRAM
    POST /chat           one completion
    POST /chat/stream    the same, as a token stream
